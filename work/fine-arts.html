Every 35 minutes the image became a little less blurred. After 5, 35 minutes sessions, we finally got to see the fully visible image...</p>

The painting depicts a dozen or so people in a brawl outside on a hill. It is a very chaotic scene that we were instructed to only show the general shapes and important details of the painting.</p>

The catch to this project, was that we weren't allowed to use fabric or any sewing to create our outfit.</p>

                                    <p>This project was unlike anything I'd done before. We were first shown a very blurred image on the projector and were told to draw it. Every 35 minutes the image became a little less blurred. After 5, 35 minutes sessions, we finally got to see the fully visible image...</p>
                                    <p>It was a black and white, upside-down version of one of my favorite paintings &mdash; <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em>  by Artemisia Gentileschi. This assignment was to teach us how to see light and shadow. It was to show us that we need to focus on large, general shapes at first, rather than get stuck working on the little details.</p>

                                    <p>This charcoal still-life drawing of several gourds inside of a frame was to practice seeing. We had to be able to see light and shading, as well as show the different importance between foreground, midground, and background.</p>

                                    <p>This is a very low-poly charcoal line and general shading copied drawing of a painting. The painting depicts a dozen or so people in a brawl outside on a hill. It is a very chaotic scene that we were instructed to only show the general shapes and important details of the painting.</p>
