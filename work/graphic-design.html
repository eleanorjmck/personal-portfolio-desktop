                                        <p>This poster series was created to raise awareness of a certain social issue. I chose to discuss marital rape, since many people do not understand what it is or how serious it is. I created three posters that can be displayed either together or apart to get the message across.</p>

                                    <h2><span>Biology</span> Symbol</h2>
                                    <h3>Graphic Design I <span> - 2019</span></h3>
                                    <p>For this logo/symbol project, we were given a word and had to design both an abstract and representational logo for that word. The word I was given was "biology".</p>
                                    <p>This project was a formal introduction into logomark making, or more broadly sign or symbol making. The task was to make dynamic and naturalistic marks with effective meaning and strong aesthetics. The project was limited to two-dimensional shapes and no additional wordmarks.</p>
                                    <p>The initial deliverables were two refined black and white symbols, one representational and one abstract, both meant to signify the chosen topic. One symbol direction was then selected and a final symbol system including black and white and color symbols was developed. The final symbol system was then applied to four different items or products that related to the topic.</p>
                                    <p>This final design and color communicate biology and science, with a new and fresh, natural feel. This symbol shows the overlapping and intertwining natural flow of nature, with an underlying structured and scientific connection between everything in the natural world.</p>
                                    <p>For the color, I chose a light, striking blue with a hint of green to symbolize freshness, innovation, and the natural world. I added dimension to the symbol by making three of the flow shapes slightly darker. This adds a suggestion of movement to the flowing shapes.</p>
